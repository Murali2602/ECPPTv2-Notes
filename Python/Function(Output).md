# Return vs Print - 
---
- ## Print - 
	Print is used to print out the things inside the function. 
	#### For example: 
	> ```python
	> def test():
	>     print('Hello World')
	> test()
	> ```

   This will output ***Hello World*** onto the screen.
 - ## Return - 
     Return is used to store the value inside the function. 
	 #### For example: 
	 > ```python
	 >def format():
	 >    
	 >    fname = input("Enter your First Name: \n")
	 >    
	 >    lname = input("Enter your Last Name: \n")
	 >   
	 >    return fname+" "+lname
	 >    
	 >name = format().title()
	 >print(name)
	 >  ```
	
	Here ***format()*** is stored as the value of return. So for example, if the input was ***MuRALI RAMACHANDRA***, the output would be ***Murali Ramachandra*** where value of format() is Murali Ramachandra.
